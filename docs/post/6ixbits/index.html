            <p>TLDR: I was in charge of creating sponsorship packages, assets, social media posts for the hackathon 6ixbits, hosted by the <a href="../toronto-youth-network">Toronto Youth Network</a>.</p>
<p>In late 2020, I was tasked with creating the branding for 6ixBits, a hackathon being hosted by the youth organization I was part of, Toronto Youth Network. This was after I’d created the branding for the Toronto Youth Network which you can read about <a href="../toronto-youth-network">here</a>. Anyways, I began by spending a lot of time on voice calls brainstorming designs: here are a few assets I came up with.</p>
<h3 id="assets" tabindex="-1">Assets</h3>
<p>I started off with assets since it would be relatively simple creating social media posts and sponsorship packages with a set theme. Furthermore, they needed to be incorporated on the website which can be viewed <a href="https://torontoyouthnetwork.com/6ixbits">here</a>. My theme was Toronto and Canada since it was going to be a virtual hackathon. They were all created in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<h3 id="social-media-posts" tabindex="-1">Social Media Posts</h3>
<p>I created these social media posts to campaign for the Hackathon. Overall it resulted in 100+ people attending the Hackathon which I thought was fairly good for our first Hackathon hosted. The assets were created and piece together in Illustrator.</p>

<h3 id="sponsorship-package" tabindex="-1">Sponsorship Package</h3>
<p>Finally, I created a sponsorship package which was sent out to 100+ sponsors. We had 20% of sponsors emailing back, willing to sponsor us. The package was created using assets made in Illustrator and pieced together on InDesign.</p>

<p>Please click the image below if you wish to take a look at the full sponsorship package. Although InDesign was a bit challenging to figure out, it was a fun process learning and creating this package.</p>
<h3 id="final-remarks" tabindex="-1">Final Remarks</h3>
<p>Being able to host this hackathon was a bit of work, but seeing it pay of was really rewarding. I’d grateful for the opportunity to have participated in something like this and I definitely learned a lot of new graphic design skills such as InDesign that I wouldn’t have learned from anywhere else.</p>
