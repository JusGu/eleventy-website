            <p>Hey there, I’m Justin Gu. I love crafting elegant solutions to complex problems</p>
<p>Creating something is all about problem-solving — my approach to web development has consistently revolved around this state-of-mind.</p>
<p>My interest in web development began when I picked up HTML and CSS while learning to create custom themes on Discord. From there on, I created my first portfolio site in high school— the revamped version of which you are looking at today!</p>
<p>My story cannot be completed without mentioning graphic design. I first began dabbling in various side-projects in 2017, and it has since then become a full-blown passion. I have won numerous graphic design competitions sponsored by companies such as Intel, MSI, AMD, and AVGL. Notably, my design has even been featured on a MSCHF billboard.</p>
<p>Fast-forwarding to my latest projects, I served as lead designer for LeRoi Robotics team 81208x, the 2021 VEX Robotics Skills Champion. As a director of the Toronto Youth Network, I launched the 6ixBits hackathon, attracting 300 participants globally. As the past president of Global Development, I have had the privilege of partnering with the University of Toronto as well as Engineers without borders, pushing forward numerous initiatives that I hope have done their part in inspiring youths like me towards careers in STEM.</p>
<p>Currently, I would like to work with impact-driven companies, interacting with like-minded professionals to expand my web development skill set. Through my designs and technology, I hope to one day resolve complex problems within the global community.</p>
