I’d won an unofficial contest and got my designs placed on a billboard and was featured in an article.</p>\n<p>Back in early 2020, I’d first heard of MSCHF through the MSCHF box, a physical box you can purchase in which you didn’t know the value of. It instantly became an internet sensation and had sold out within a few days. I decided to investigate more into the company which resulted in me joining their largest unofficial discord server where they were hosting a graphic design contest. Being the graphic designer I was, I decided to sign up and submit a few designs I thought were interesting (along with 100 ish other designs from talented designers) and patiently waited not expecting to win anything. However, a few days later, I was contacted by the organizers and that’s when I realized I’d won an (unofficial) MSCHF contest and my design was going to be placed on a billboard in NYC.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-designs\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Designs</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/portfolio-3/mschf/Untitled.png\" alt=\"Design #1: Minimalist but gets to the point. Red accent to attract attention and curiosity immediately, essential for an advert that people only get 2-3 seconds to look at.\"></p>\n<p>Design #1: Minimalist but gets to the point.

It didn’t take much convincing since everyone wanted to see the billboards on display as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/portfolio-3/mschf/Untitled%205.png\" alt=\"Untitled\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/portfolio-3/mschf/Untitled%206.png\" alt=\"On March 14th, 2020, Designs #2 and #3 were showcased on the billboards.

Funny thing, I didn’t even know someone had written about this until I’d search up MSCHF Billboard on Google images and saw my billboards!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/portfolio-3\">All Works</a></p>\n",
