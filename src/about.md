Hey there, I’m Justin Gu. I love crafting elegant solutions to complex problems

Creating something is all about problem-solving — my approach to software development has consistently revolved around this state-of-mind.

My interest in software development began when I picked up HTML and CSS while learning to create custom themes on Discord. From there on, I created my first portfolio site in high school— the revamped version of which you are looking at today!

I completed my first internship at the [Government of Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/government-ontario) where most notably, I worked on the an application to modernize data collection. I was in charge of creating a new feature which allowed internal government employees to send application migration data online to be collected in an Oracle Database - similiar to Google Forms.

Currently, I would like to work with impact-driven companies, interacting with like-minded professionals to expand my web development skill set. Through my designs and technology, I hope to one day resolve complex problems within the global community.
