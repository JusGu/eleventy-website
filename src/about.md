Hey there, I’m Justin Gu. I love crafting elegant solutions to complex problems

Creating something is all about problem-solving — my approach to web development has consistently revolved around this state-of-mind. 

### Software Development
My interest in software development began when I picked up HTML and CSS while learning to create custom themes on Discord. From there on, I created my first portfolio site in high school— the revamped version of which you are looking at today!

Recently, I complete my first internship at the [Government of Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/government-ontario) where most notably, I worked on the an application to modernize data collection. I was in charge of creating a new feature which allowed internal government employees to send application migration data online to be collected in an Oracle Database - similiar to Google Forms.

### Graphic Design
My story cannot be completed without mentioning graphic design. I first began dabbling in various side-projects in 2017, and it has since then become a full-blown passion. I have won numerous graphic design competitions sponsored by companies such as Intel, MSI, AMD, and AVGL. Notably, my design has even been featured on a MSCHF billboard.

Furthermore, I served as lead designer for LeRoi Robotics team 81208x, the 2021 VEX Robotics Skills Champion. As a director of the Toronto Youth Network, I launched the 6ixBits hackathon, attracting 300 participants globally. As the past president of Global Development, I have had the privilege of partnering with the University of Toronto as well as Engineers Without Borders, pushing forward numerous initiatives that I hope have done their part in inspiring youths like me towards careers in STEM.

Currently, I would like to work with impact-driven companies, interacting with like-minded professionals to expand my web development skill set. Through my designs and technology, I hope to one day resolve complex problems within the global community.
