TLDR: I created the branding to Toronto Youth Network 2020

In early 2020, I was approached by my friend George Shao for a pretty exciting opportunity: to host a hackathon. He was running Toronto Youth Network that year, a youth organization specializing in providing meaningful networking skills and had a history of hosting hackathons. We decided to recreate the logo for this years hackathon in order to give the youth network a revamped look. 

After some heavy initial brainstorming,  we knew we had to focus on the CN tower: the landmark of Toronto. Some early versions of the logo were created but were not very pretty.

### The Process

After some revising and talks with other graphic designers, I was in charge of modelling a quick line sketch of the CN tower as a starting point:

I added a gradient to the text but then I realized the gradient was really ugly. Thus I decided to go with a solid colour.

I then created a nicer coloured version of the logo. I also added some shadows and highlights to the CN tower to make it look more 3D.

Finally, after realizing this colourful logo wasn’t going to work on most merchandise due to it’s huge range of colours I decided to only keep the shadows of the CN tower completely black.

### The Result

It was really fun and challenging working for the Toronto Youth Network. I’d definitely learned a lot working with other designers as well and I’d quite happy with how the final logo turned out :). After designing this, I had an even bigger task ahead of me: [the hackathon we were hosting](../6ixbits/).
