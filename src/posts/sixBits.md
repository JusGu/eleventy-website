TLDR: I was in charge of creating sponsorship packages, assets, social media posts for the hackathon 6ixbits, hosted by the [Toronto Youth Network](../toronto-youth-network).

In late 2020, I was tasked with creating the branding for 6ixBits, a hackathon being hosted by the youth organization I was part of, Toronto Youth Network. This was after I’d created the branding for the Toronto Youth Network which you can read about [here](../toronto-youth-network). Anyways, I began by spending a lot of time on voice calls brainstorming designs: here are a few assets I came up with.

### Assets

I started off with assets since it would be relatively simple creating social media posts and sponsorship packages with a set theme. Furthermore, they needed to be incorporated on the website which can be viewed [here](https://torontoyouthnetwork.com/6ixbits). My theme was Toronto and Canada since it was going to be a virtual hackathon. They were all created in Adobe Illustrator.

### Social Media Posts

I created these social media posts to campaign for the Hackathon. Overall it resulted in 100+ people attending the Hackathon which I thought was fairly good for our first Hackathon hosted. The assets were created and piece together in Illustrator.

### Sponsorship Package

Finally, I created a sponsorship package which was sent out to 100+ sponsors. We had 20% of sponsors emailing back, willing to sponsor us. The package was created using assets made in Illustrator and pieced together on InDesign.

### Final Remarks

Being able to host this hackathon was a bit of work, but seeing it pay of was really rewarding. I’d grateful for the opportunity to have participated in something like this and I definitely learned a lot of new graphic design skills such as InDesign that I wouldn’t have learned from anywhere else.
